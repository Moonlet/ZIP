## Abstract

This ZIP details the address standard adopted by the Zilliqa blockchain. This ZIP provides the concise details of the `bech32` address format customised for the Zilliqa protocol.

## Motivation

Due to `EIP-55` being not widely adopted by wallets and exchanges, the 20-bytes `base16` checksum variation used by Zilliqa protocol to prevent the loss of funds sent to an Ethereum address is not viable.

Hence, this ZIP proposes that Zilliqa adopt a variation of the `bech32` format on the wallets/SDKs level to prevent users from sending interim ERC20 ZIL tokens from their Ethereum wallets (i.e. MyCrypto/MyEtherWallet) to a native ZIL address and vice versa.

The native protocol will still utilises the 20-bytes `base16` checksum on the backend. This is a cosmetic change of the 20-bytes `base16` checksum address to `bech32` format on the wallets and SDKs level only. It is only be visible to end-users.

## Specification

Please refer to [`bip-0173`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki#bech32) for more details of the `bech32` technical specification.

A Zilliqa `bech32` checksummed address consists of the following aspects:

|               | Human-readable prefix | separator | `bech32` formatted address         | checksum |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Example 1** | `zil`                 | `1`       | `02n74869xnvdwq3yh8p0k9jjgtejruft` | `268tg8` |
| **Example 2** | `zil`                 | `1`       | `48fy8yjxn6jf5w36kqc7x73qd3ufuu24` | `a4u8t9` |
| **Example 3** | `zil`                 | `1`       | `fdv7u7rll9epgcqv9xxh9lhwq427nsql` | `58qcs9` |

- Do note that the human-readable prefix for [Zilliqa mainnet](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa) is `zil`, and the human-readable prefix for [Zilliqa Developer testnet](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa?network=testnet) is also `zil`.
- Do also note that the last six characters of the data part form a checksum and contain no information.

## Rationale

### Previous solution

Zilliqa previous address format utilises a different 20 bytes checksum mechanism from Ethereum to prevent the issue of erroneous funds transfers between an Ethereum and a Zilliqa address. However, due to [EIP-55](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md) being not widely adopted by wallets and exchanges, this solution became not viable as a preventive mechanism.

### Bech32 address format

The rationale to move to `Zilliqa Bech32 format` is to prevent confusion with Ethereum address. 

Using Zilliqaâ€™s address format that consists of 20 bytes led to some confusion due to similarity with Ethereum address format. Any tokens mistakenly sent to the wrong address would lead to irreversible loss of the tokens. This is because the one address on Zilliqa does not correspond to the same private key on Ethereum, due to the difference of hash functions used (`sha256` vs `keccak` respectively).

## Backward Compatibility

This ZIP is backward compatible as the required changes are only on the wallet and SDKs level. There is no change required on the core protocol layer.

## Test Cases 

This ZIP uses the public key `039fbf7df13d0b6798fa16a79daabb97d4424062d2f8bd4e9a7c7851e732a25e1d` as a testcase and example:

- Mainnet legacy `base16` checksummed address: `0x7Aa7eA9f4534d8D70224b9c2FB165242F321F12b`
- Mainnet `bech32` checksummed address: `zil102n74869xnvdwq3yh8p0k9jjgtejruft268tg8`
- Testnet `bech32` checksummed address: `zil102n74869xnvdwq3yh8p0k9jjgtejruft268tg8`

## Implementations

### Reference encoder and decoder:

#### SDKs

  - [For JavaScript](https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa-JavaScript-Library/blob/dev/packages/zilliqa-js-crypto/src/bech32.ts)
  - [For Golang](https://github.com/Zilliqa/gozilliqa-sdk/blob/master/bech32/bech32.go)
  - [For Java](https://github.com/FireStack-Lab/LaksaJ/blob/master/src/main/java/com/firestack/laksaj/utils/Bech32.java)
  - [For Python](https://github.com/deepgully/pyzil/blob/master/pyzil/crypto/bech32.py)

#### Online utility tool

  - [Zilliqa Address Tool](https://www.coinhako.com/zil-check)

#### Sample sanity implementation

In order to support both bech32 (DEFAULT) and legacy base16 (OPTIONAL) address formats, it is recommended to refer to the code snippet below to perform a sanity check with the utility tools provided by our official [`zilliqa-js` SDK](https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa-JavaScript-Library):

```javascript
  private normaliseAddress(address: string) {
    if (validation.isBech32(address)) {
      return fromBech32Address(address);
    }

    if (isValidChecksumAddress(address)) {
      return address;
    }

    throw new Error('Wrong address format, should be either bech32 or checksummed address');
  }
```

### Explorer

[Viewblock explorer](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa) supports both the new `bech32` and legacy `base16` checksummed address format in the search bar to ease the transition to `bech32` checksummed addresses for all Users.
